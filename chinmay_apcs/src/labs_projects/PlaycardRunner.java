 * 12/2021 Add sort method in Hand class
 *
 * This is the lab for unit 7 to practice ArrayList.
 * It will use 3 classes: Card, Deck, and Hand (in another file)
 * This runner program makes a new deck, a new hand, and add cards to the deck.
 * It shuffles the deck and the hand draws cards from the deck.
 * It uses string printing to show the result.
